/**
 * 
 * In Java, the volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value 
 * will be modified by multiple threads. 
 * 
 * It ensures that any read or write operation on that variable is done directly 
 * from and to the main memory, rather than being cached 
 * in a thread's local memory (also known as a CPU cache). 
 * 
 * This helps to avoid problems where one thread might not see the updated value 
 * of the variable because of caching.
 * 
 * Hereâ€™s what volatile guarantees:
 * - Visibility: When a variable is marked as volatile, all threads will immediately see 
 * the most up-to-date value of the variable. If one thread updates a volatile variable, 
 * that change will be visible to all other threads that access it.
 * - Atomicity of Reads/Writes: A volatile variable ensures that reads and writes 
 * to the variable are atomic, meaning they cannot be interrupted or partially completed. 
 * This applies to primitive types like int, boolean, etc.
 * 
 * However, volatile does not ensure atomicity for complex operations 
 * (such as incrementing a variable or checking and updating its value).
 * E.g. incrementing/decrementing an int variable
 * 
 * You would need additional synchronization mechanisms, 
 * like synchronized or java.util.concurrent.atomic classes, 
 * for such compound actions.
 *
